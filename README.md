# simoldation

A *Physarum* slime mold transport network simulation inspired by [Sebastian Lague's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A) and based on Jeff Jones's paper *[Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579)*. The simulation works, but it's very slow (~10 FPS in a 200x200 viewport on GeForce GTX 1050 Ti). I'm currently learning OpenGL (which is currently poorly utilized by the codebase) and C++ to rewrite the project and make it more performant.
